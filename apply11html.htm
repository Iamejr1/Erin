<p>
The best way to build good credit is to create the habit of charging only what you can afford. Lenders know that borrowers who max out their cards often have difficulty repaying what they've borrowed.Keeping your balance below 30% of your credit limit is best for building good credit.Many first-time credit card users accumulate a collection of credit cards within their first few years of using credit. Don't make the mistake of opening up too many credit cards too soon.
